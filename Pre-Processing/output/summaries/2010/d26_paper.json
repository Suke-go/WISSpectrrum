The system collects information from the web and social media, extracts HTML and URLs, integrates with social media search APIs, and the physical prototype was built at approximately 100×70×70mm using a general-purpose microcontroller and an external DC 12V power supply.\nPositioning Summary: This research positions itself as a system in the web/social media domain that mediates between notables and people. This research positions the collection and presentation of web information as important for promoting contact and dialogue between the two groups.\nPurpose Summary: This study aims to close the information-contact gap between notables and ordinary citizens. This study aims to provide an intermediary function that affects both the notable side and the general public side.\nMethod Summary: This study designed a prototype intermediary system that collects, extracts, and displays information from the web and social media. This study performed HTML and URL extraction and integration with social media search APIs and constructed a physical prototype approximately 100×70×70mm using a general-purpose microcontroller and an external DC 12V power supply.\nEvaluation Summary: This study evaluated the system by performing web data collection, data retrieval via social media search APIs, and construction and operation confirmation of a physical prototype. This study reported data retrieval and operation confirmation of the physical prototype but did not report detailed outcomes such as participant numbers or quantitative evaluation results.\n\nCandidate concepts:\n1.
