This study targeted PC workers and investigated desktop notification implementations by proposing four notification designs, including one shift-type notification, to encourage posture change.\nPositioning Summary: This study is positioned in the research area of developing notification methods that change user posture while minimizing task interruptions. This study focuses on reducing health burdens from prolonged PC work and targets PC workers by balancing task continuation and posture modification.\nPurpose Summary: The purpose of this study is to develop a concrete notification method that balances task continuation and posture change so that PC users can correct posture without interrupting work. The study targets PC workers and aims to improve posture during prolonged work by designing notifications that do not degrade task continuity.\nMethod Summary: This study proposed a notification method running on the PC desktop and implemented desktop notifications to promote posture change. This study presented four notification designs, including a shift-type notification, and examined concrete design elements such as on-screen presentation and timing.\n\nCandidate concepts:\n1.
