The proposed system introduces a mechanism to re-display unattended utterances to promote reattention and aims to restore buried utterances into conversation among chat participants. Specific implementation details and evaluation results are not provided.\nPositioning Summary: This study is positioned in the chat domain with a focus on addressing the problem of unattended utterances becoming buried in conversation. The study's positioning targets promoting dialogue among chat participants who are affected by buried utterances.\nPurpose Summary: The purpose of this study is to solve the specific problem of unattended utterances becoming buried in conversation and to promote dialogue among chat participants. The proposed aim is to promote interaction among chat participants by using a mechanism that brings buried utterances back to attention.\nMethod Summary: This study proposes a chat system that centers on a mechanism to re-display unattended utterances to bring them back to attention. The proposed system adopts a design that re-displays abandoned utterances to prompt reattention and aims to revive buried utterances to activate conversation.\n\nCandidate concepts:\n1.
