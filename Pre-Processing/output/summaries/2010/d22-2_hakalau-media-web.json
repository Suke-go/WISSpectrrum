This study integrated timeline display and in-browser 3D rendering with audio playback into a wiki-based platform and operated a timeline example showing 2004–2010 history at a 2010 summit.\nPositioning Summary: This study positions user-generated archives (UGA) as distinct from user-generated content (UGC) because UGA focuses on long-term preservation and reuse. This study addresses the lack of systematic accumulation and archiving on the web despite increasing UGC and emphasizes UGA from the perspective of long-term preservation and reuse.\nPurpose Summary: The purpose of this study is to propose a web application platform that promotes the creation and preservation of user-generated archives (UGA) for content creators and communities. This study aims to design and operate a platform that supports content creators and communities to facilitate UGA creation and preservation.\nMethod Summary: This study designed a wiki-based UGA platform and implemented features such as timeline display and in-browser 3D rendering with audio playback. This study implemented a timeline feature and used in-browser 3D rendering API equivalents and audio data API equivalents, and operated a timeline example showing 2004–2010 history at a 2010 summit.\n\nCandidate concepts:\n1.
