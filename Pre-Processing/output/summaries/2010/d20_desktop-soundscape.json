The proposed soundscape implements acoustic representations of task states to enable task awareness without relying on visual channels.\nPositioning Summary: This work addresses the problem that task states in a desktop work environment are hard to perceive and that this lack of perception leads to decreased work efficiency. The work positions itself as aiming to improve desktop workers' efficiency by promoting task awareness through non-visual means.\nPurpose Summary: The purpose of this work is to improve work efficiency in desktop environments. To achieve this purpose, the work targets desktop workers and aims to resolve the lack of task reflection by representing task states audibly to increase efficiency.\nMethod Summary: This work proposes a soundscape method that acoustically represents task states on the desktop. The method implements a system that generates soundscapes reflecting task states and focuses on design and implementation to enable task awareness without relying on visual channels.\n\nCandidate concepts:\n1.
