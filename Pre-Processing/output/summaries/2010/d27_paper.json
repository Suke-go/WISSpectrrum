The study combines mechanisms that manipulate time perception with scheduling elements and reverse processing to influence work efficiency and schedule design.\nPositioning Summary: This study aims to resolve difficulties in task division within schedule design by using the illusion of time sense. The study targets difficulties in scheduling at time units such as 24 hours and aims to support both workers and schedule designers.\nPurpose Summary: The purpose of this study is to resolve difficulties in dividing work in time units such as 24 hours and to support task division. The study aims to provide division support for workers and schedule designers by manipulating perceived time.\nMethod Summary: The proposed system is based on the concept that time can be programmed and uses the illusion of time sense. The system combines three elements—manipulation of time perception, scheduling elements (such as grouping of time), and reverse processing—to realize support for dividing time.\n\nCandidate concepts:\n1.
