This study designed display experiments using whitespace and HTML fragments and compared rendering behavior across multiple social media environments and browsers, showing that rendering differences can affect user expression.\nPositioning Summary: This study is positioned as research that addresses how whitespace characters and HTML rendering on social media affect the appearance and expression of posts. This study is positioned to emphasize that differences in whitespace and HTML handling across the examined social media environments and browsers can influence communication.\nPurpose Summary: The purpose of this study is to clarify differences in whitespace and HTML handling across social media services and browsers and to elucidate the problem of unintended changes in expression. The purpose of this study is to target issues that affect social media users and web developers and to identify display discrepancies across multiple environments.\nMethod Summary: This study adopted a method of designing display experiments using whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) and HTML fragments to analyze rendering behavior. This study used whitespace inspection tools and HTML visualization techniques to provide identical inputs to multiple social media environments and browsers and compared the rendering results for analysis.\nEvaluation Summary: This study evaluated the approach by conducting experiments that input HTML fragments and whitespace patterns into multiple social media environments and browsers and compared the rendering results.
