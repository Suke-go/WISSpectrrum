The system embeds tool-specific IDs into barcodes, implements distribution via physical tags and digital displays with integration to existing services, and was evaluated with an image-editing software task involving about 30 participants measuring Q&A occurrences and changes in connections among same-tool users.\nPositioning Summary: This study is positioned to address the limitation that existing social services and Q&A platforms do not sufficiently connect tool-specific users. This study relates to mobile tagging and exhibition interaction research while proposing a barcode-based approach to directly link users of the same software or hardware.\nPurpose Summary: The purpose of this study is to directly connect users who use the same tools to promote support and knowledge sharing among tool users. The study aims to address gaps in existing services by using barcodes/IDs to link users of the same software or hardware.\nMethod Summary: The system embeds tool-specific IDs into barcodes (equivalent to QR codes) and uses barcode scanning to connect users who use the same tools. The system implements a design that assumes ID distribution via physical tags and digital displays and integration with existing services, providing a technical mechanism to generate connections among tool users through barcode reading.\nEvaluation Summary: The study conducted a user evaluation that included tasks using image-editing software and observation of Q&A behavior. The study evaluated multiple experimental conditions with about 30 participants using metrics of Q&A occurrences and changes in connections among same-tool users, and it observed results suggesting the system had an effect on those metrics.\n\nCandidate concepts:\n1.
